# Changelog

All notable changes to microide are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow semantic versioning. microide remains **experimental**
(see [README](README.md)); versions track meaningful shipped work rather than stability promises.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-14

First tagged release. Builds on the 1.0.0 baseline with editor, diff/merge, git, search, save,
and shell improvements.

### Editor
- Multi-caret position remap with region-stack highlighting and smarter copy-with-context.
- Coalesce typed runs into word-level undo steps.
- Suppress occurrence highlight while actively typing; centralize caret moves.
- Correct soft-wrap caret row resolution and fold/scroll spans; add hanging indent.
- Resolve folds for visible long methods and unify the fold marker as a single `+`/`-` button.

### Diff & Merge
- Unify decorated-row assembly across editor, compare, and merge surfaces.
- Centralize intra-line underline assembly and git conflict-marker / collapsed-run helpers.
- Speed pass: intern diff lines as `string_view` in compare model build; drop dead tokenization
  in exact line-ops; large-file fallback round-trip coverage.
- Unblock horizontal scroll and stop the change marker overlapping line numbers.

### Git
- Restructure the source-control panel and add a branch/commit ref picker.
- Make the commit message editable; improve the source tree and commit flow.

### Search
- Parallelize project search with count-all and match highlighting.

### Save
- Durable writes, save-time conflict guard, and a non-blocking external-change banner.

### UI & Shell
- Deferred-commit tab drag with ghost and consistent behavior across all three tab types.
- Two-pane Settings overlay redesign; collapse the Help menu.
- Simplify the top menu bar and dedup it against Settings; replace a dropdown with dedicated buttons.
- Centralize chrome primitives and share single-line input behaviors.
- Wrap Help/About text and add a Settings/Help overlay scrollbar.
- Keep tree focus when opening a file from the sidebar; detach project-search results scroll from
  the active result.

## [1.0.0]

Baseline native single-window IDE shell (bumped from 0.1.0, not separately tagged): built-in
editor with multi-project/file tabs and shared-buffer splits, compare and three-way merge tabs,
git sidebar with staging and commit, async project search and file finder, PTY-backed terminal
tabs, and a Lua 5.4 plugin runtime with host-owned registries.
