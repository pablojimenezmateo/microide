// `StartupTrace` and `PerformanceTrace` are thin facades over this. Before this
// type existed they were two byte-identical copies of the same state struct, env
// parsing, `EnsureStarted`, `DurationMs`, and `Scope` body -- so every fix to one
// (thread-local depth, the label-copy allocation, aggregation) had to be made

// A channel has two independent output modes:
//
//   stream     one stderr line per scope, indented by nesting depth. This is the
//              original behaviour of both tracers. It is a firehose: the write
//              plus flush happens inside the measured region's parent, so
//              streaming a hot inner scope perturbs what it is measuring.
//
//   aggregate  per-label count / total / self / max, ranked by self time and
//              printed once at exit. This is the mode to use when hunting for a
//              hotspot: no per-scope I/O, and the answer arrives pre-sorted.
//
// Both modes may be on at once. `Enabled()` is true if either is.
